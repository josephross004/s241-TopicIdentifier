I kept searching for you in the stars
When I questioned them as a child
I asked the mountains for you
But they gave me solitude and brief peace
Only a few times
Because you werent there in the long evenings
I considered the rash blasphemy
That the world was Godâ€™s error 
Myself an error in the world
And when I was face to face with death
No I shouted from every fibre
I hadnt finished yet
There was still too much to do 
Because you were there before me
With me beside you just like today
A man a woman under the sun
I came back because you were there
